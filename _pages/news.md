<h4>
<b> Academic and Professional Involvement</b></h4>

<br>

My dedication to advancing the field of communication and journalism is reflected through my active participation in various roles. Since 2022, I have been a <b>journal reviewer</b> for [<em>Journalism Studies</em>](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rjos20) and the [<em>International Journal of Communication</em>](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc), critically reviewing scholarly work and contributing to the academic discourse on media and communication.

In 2023, I took on the role of <b>panel co-organizer & chair</b> for the session titled "The Future of News Images in a Social Media World" at the [Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC)](https://www.aejmc.org/) 106th Annual Conference. This panel explored the evolving dynamics of news imagery in the age of social media. Additionally, I served as a <b>conference reviewer</b> for the [International Communication Association](https://www.icahdq.org/) in 2024, assessing scholarly papers to help shape the conference program.

<h4>
<b>Contributions to Media and Social Justice</b></h4>

<br>

In 2023, I was honored to be an <b>invited panelist</b> for a panel titled ["'Woman, Life, Freedom': Reporting #MahsaAmini protests in solidarity,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EcrTkkmtl8) part of the Solidarity Journalism Initiative at the [Center for Media Engagement, University of Texas at Austin](https://mediaengagement.org/).

<br>

Further contributing to the dialogue on media and uprisings, I co-organized and co-chaired a panel on "Iranian uprisings and (non)mainstream journalism: Possibilities and limitations" at the Department of Journalism & Media Studies, Rutgers University, in the winter of 2023. This panel addressed the critical intersection of media coverage and political movements.

<h4>
<b> Leadership and Organizational Roles</b></h4>

<br>

My leadership experience includes serving as a <b>board member</b> for the Doctoral Students Association at the School of Communication and Information, Rutgers University from 2022 to 2023. Here, I contributed to the academic and professional development of doctoral students. Similarly, I was involved with the Communication, Culture, and Media Graduate Students Association at Drexel University as a Board Member from 2020 to 2021, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment for graduate students.

Lastly, my organizational skills were highlighted as the <b>head of the organization committee</b> for the [Annual Photo Exhibition at the School of Fine Arts, University of Tehran](https://utphotoex.ir/en/). This even, which has become an ongoing tradition, now in its eighth year, aims to explore and elevate the role of academic photography in Iran's art scene by fostering interaction between the national photography community and academic photographers through specialized sessions, critiques, and artist discussions.
