<h4>
<b>Journey into Visual Communication and Digital Media</b></h4>
Before entering academia, I spent time in the advertising and marketing industry, where my passion for visual communication and digital media grew. This experience deepened my curiosity about the theories behind media effects and persuasion in the digital world, eventually leading me to graduate school.

Notable Projects
Photo Shooting for National Men's Soccer Team Advocacy
In 2018, I initiated a photo shoot in response to a controversial billboard by the Iranian government promoting the Iran national football team at the World Cup. To challenge the prevalent sexism and patriarchy in Iran, I invited staff members of all genders to participate in a session advocating for equality. The resulting photo went viral, sparking discussions on gender equality.

Video Production for Public Relations Campaign
I also produced a video for a public relations campaign, featuring interviews with key figures involved in a brand's advertisements, including the director, writer, designer, and other actors. The video provided a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, showcasing the advanced skills and creativity of the art groups at Badkoobeh Advertising Company.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
