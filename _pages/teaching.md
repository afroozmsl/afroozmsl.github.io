My teaching philosophy is anchored in the belief that education extends beyond knowledge transfer; it is about empowering students to become critical thinkers, active learners, and engaged citizens. I have taught undergraduateâ€”and graduate-level courses as an instructor of record and served as a teaching assistant for some other courses, summarized below.

### **Instructor of Record**

\

##### ** *Digital Media Research* (graduate-level, Rutgers University)**
##### Summer 2022, 2023, 2024


 I have had the opportunity to teach Digital Media Research as the instructor of record on three occasions and have received an overall 4.62/5 teaching effectiveness rating. Through this course, students will be introduced to some fundamental quantitative, qualitative, and interpretive methods for doing research on digital media (online media, mobile media, and social media) and ethical ways of employing those methods. Students will learn about how to apply these methods to studies of digital media creation, content, and use. At the end of this course, students will have a solid understanding of how to develop a research question, as well as several general research methods used by digital media scholars. You will also gain an appreciation for the ethical considerations involved in conducting research on human subjects.  
 

#####*** Techniques of Speaking * (undergraduate-level, Drexel University) **
##### Winter & Spring 2021 


I taught a public speaking course at Drexel University twice, designed as an interactive workshop to enhance students' skills in delivering various types of speeches, including explanation, persuasion, and argumentation. The course covered key aspects of public speaking such as topic selection, research, organization, and effective presentation techniques. Through practice and critique, students learned to give and receive feedback, use rhetoric effectively, and apply different genres of public speaking.


#####*** Business Communication * (undergraduate-level, Drexel University) **
##### Summer & Fall 2020 


This course, which I taught two times, focused on developing written communication skills, particularly emphasizing blogs, letters, and proposals. The course also incorporated collaborative writing and covered various other communication forms, such as emails, application letters, summaries, instructions, and resumes. Students learned to differentiate audiences in business writing, craft basic business communications like blogs and complaint letters, and collaborate on research projects to create business reports. They were trained in research methods and citations. Additionally, the course included developing proposals for both business and academic contexts and summarizing reports effectively. By the end, students were equipped with practical writing skills applicable to a range of professional tasks.
