My teaching philosophy is anchored in the belief that education extends beyond knowledge transfer; it is about empowering students to become critical thinkers, active learners, and engaged citizens. I have taught undergraduate—and graduate-level courses as an instructor of record and served as a teaching assistant for some other courses, summarized below.

#### **Instructor of Record**


##### **_Introduction to Media_ (undergraduate-level, Rutgers University)**

##### Summer 2025, Fall 2025

I have been teaching Introduction to Media as the instructor of record, with a total of 85 students enrolled across offerings. This course introduces students to the history, structures, and impacts of media, tracing developments from early print to today’s algorithm-driven digital platforms. We examine how media industries evolve, how messages are created and distributed, and how audiences interpret and respond to them. Special emphasis is placed on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reshaping media production, distribution, and consumption, and on the cultural, political, and ethical implications of these shifts. Students develop critical media literacy skills to navigate today’s complex information environment. 

##### **_Digital Media Research_ (graduate-level, Rutgers University)**

##### Summer 2022, 2023, 2024

I have had the opportunity to teach Digital Media Research as the instructor of record on three occasions and have received an overall 4.62/5 teaching effectiveness rating. Through this course, students will be introduced to some fundamental quantitative, qualitative, and interpretive methods for doing research on digital media (online media, mobile media, and social media) and ethical ways of employing those methods. Students will learn about how to apply these methods to studies of digital media creation, content, and use. At the end of this course, students will have a solid understanding of how to develop a research question, as well as several general research methods used by digital media scholars. You will also gain an appreciation for the ethical considerations involved in conducting research on human subjects.  
 

##### **_Techniques of Speaking_ (undergraduate-level, Drexel University)**

##### Winter & Spring 2021 

I taught a public speaking course at Drexel University twice, designed as an interactive workshop to enhance students' skills in delivering various types of speeches, including explanation, persuasion, and argumentation. The course covered key aspects of public speaking such as topic selection, research, organization, and effective presentation techniques. Through practice and critique, students learned to give and receive feedback, use rhetoric effectively, and apply different genres of public speaking.


##### **_Business Communication_ (undergraduate-level, Drexel University)**

##### Summer & Fall 2020

This course, which I taught two times, focused on developing written communication skills, particularly emphasizing blogs, letters, and proposals. The course also incorporated collaborative writing and covered various other communication forms, such as emails, application letters, summaries, instructions, and resumes. Students learned to differentiate audiences in business writing, craft basic business communications like blogs and complaint letters, and collaborate on research projects to create business reports. They were trained in research methods and citations. Additionally, the course included developing proposals for both business and academic contexts and summarizing reports effectively. By the end, students were equipped with practical writing skills applicable to a range of professional tasks.
